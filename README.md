# Hyperskill-Meal-Planner
This is a completed Hyperskill project, which I selected as part of the platform's project-based learning model.

This CLI program allows a user to create and save meals with an ingredients list. These meals can then be attached to a weekly plan for each day of the week's breakfast, lunch, and dinner that a user can access from a DB. (Note that this is not hosted, so you would need to have a local Postgres DB available).

## Learned From Each Stage:

### Stage 1:
* Basic I/O and input handling

### Stage 2:
* Input validation with regex
* I/O Looping

### Stage 3:
* Utilizing Java's OOP principles for modularizing code
* Connecting to and using a Postgres DB in Java through JDBC
* Sanitizing inputs using PreparedStatement

### Stage 4:
* More JDBC usage

### Stage 5:
* Utilizing relational DBs to organize and track daily meal lists

### Stage 6:
* File operations in Java
* More complex SQL operations (FIltered JOIN)
